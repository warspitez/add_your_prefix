# File Renaming Script

## Overview

This Python script allows you to add a user-defined prefix to the filenames of all files in the same directory as the script. It's particularly useful for quickly organizing or categorizing files.

## Usage

1. Save the script in the directory containing the files you want to rename.

2. Run the script by executing it with Python:

3. Enter the desired prefix when prompted.

4. The script will rename all files in the directory, excluding the script file itself, by adding the specified prefix.

============================================================================================

Caution

Make sure to have a backup of your files before running the script, especially if you are testing it on important data.

The script skips renaming its own file to avoid unintended changes to the script.

Note

This script uses the os module to interact with the file system.

For any issues or improvements, feel free to contribute or report them in the repository.

Happy file organising!
